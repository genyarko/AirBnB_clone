README.md for AirBnB clone project
This project is a clone of the popular accommodation rental website AirBnB. The goal of this project is to build a command-line interpreter that allows users to create, read, update, and delete objects from a file storage system.

Command Interpreter
How to start the command interpreter
To start the command interpreter, run the console.py file with the following command:

shell
Copy code
$ ./console.py
How to use the command interpreter
Once the command interpreter is running, you will see a prompt that looks like this:

scss
Copy code
(hbnb)
This means that the command interpreter is waiting for input. You can type in commands and the interpreter will execute them. To see a list of available commands, type help:

scss
Copy code
(hbnb) help
Examples
Here are some examples of commands that you can use in the command interpreter:

To create a new object:
sql
Copy code
(hbnb) create User
To show a specific object:
sql
Copy code
(hbnb) show User 1234-5678-9012
To update an object:

Copy code
(hbnb) update User 1234-5678-9012 name "John Doe"
To delete an object:
